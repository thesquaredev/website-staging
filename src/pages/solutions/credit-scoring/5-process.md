# <sup>_1_ _</sup>  Product application
## visa-bold-green.png

When applying for a financial product, e.g. a car loan or a bank loan, the customer is usually requested 
to upload a tax clearance document, a payroll slip and maybe other documents that prove financial status. Using our 
platform, though, that won't be necessary, all is needed is user's consent.

# <sup>_2_ _</sup>  Processing customer data
## settings-desktop-bold-red.png

The lender requests customer's consent to access account data, either by sending an invitation from our platform, or by 
clicking an embedded button in the lender's website. After accessing their account information, using a GDPR compliant 
authentication process, financial data is processed and delivered to the lender through our platform's dashboard.

# <sup>_3_ _</sup> Credit scoring
## gauge-dashboard-bold-blue.png

Customer's financial information is categorized and aggregated. Our model will analyze spending habits to predict 
whether the consumer will repay or not. Aggregated data and the credit score becomes available to the lender within our
platform's dashboard.

# <sup>_4_ _</sup> Credit decision
## desktop-monitor-smiley-bold-green.png

The lender will use our credit score to make a decision. Our findings are also shared with the customer, in a friendly 
and explainable format, to achieve transparency and a better customer experience.
