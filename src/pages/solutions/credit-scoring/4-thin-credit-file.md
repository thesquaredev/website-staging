The banking sector faces a lot of challenges when it comes to make a decision around credit risk. Not all customer are 
paid monthly (e.g. gig economy), not all of them have a credit file (e.g. they just moved from abroad) and not all of
them play fair (e.g. fraudulent applications). With the incorporation of income verification into your existing 
processes, you can meet these challenges and take the right decisions.
