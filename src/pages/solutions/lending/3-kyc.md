SMEs that wish to get a better deal when it comes to lending, have better possibilities by allowing access to their 
account data. By identifying turnover in real time through Open Banking (PSD2), banks and lenders can make wiser 
decisions and eventually give a better offer. On the other hand, lenders might be interested in current liabilities
for the customer, that cannot be found in credit bureaus. Combining this information with analysis offered from our 
solution in real time makes Open Banking a powerful tool in the KYC process.
