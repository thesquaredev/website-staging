# This markdown file will render a "pills" component. A section that renders a "pills" component shows specifically 
# three squared cards that are placed inside what ever is above them. It is designed to be used right after a "hero"
# section. Be cautious if used with other sections. The following properties may be set (properties with * are 
# required, to leave a property blank use ''):
#
# template*: The page template to use, leave it "default" if not sure
# component*: The React component to use (here is "pills")
##
template: default
component: pills
#
# HOW TO USE TEXT BELOW:
#
# Each H1 header (rows starting with #) becomes the card's title
# Each H2 header (rows starting with ##) becomes the card's icon
# Each paragraph (rows with just text) becomes the card's main text
