# This markdown file will render a "cards" component, which contains a series of cards (2 for each row). If a headline 
# is given it will not show the first card but the headline. The following properties may be set (properties with * are 
# required, to leave a property blank use ''):
#
# template*: The page template to use, leave it "default" if not sure
# component*: The React component to use (here is "cards")
# headline: The text that appears above all texts
# moreTxt: The "show more" text for each card
# linkUrl: The link to be followed when card is clicked 
##
template: default
component: cards
headline: See what Squaredev can do for your enterprise
moreTxt: Learn more
linkUrl: 
#
# HOW TO USE TEXT BELOW:
#
# Each H1 headline (rows starting with #) becomes the card's title
# Each H2 headline (rows starting with ##) becomes the card's subtitle
# Each H3 headline (rows starting with ###) becomes the card's image
# Each paragraph (rows with just text) becomes the card's content
