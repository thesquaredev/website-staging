We have come to a point where we can stop thinking of programming as writing a step of instructions in a programming language like C or Java or Python. Instead, we can program by example. We can collect many examples of what we want the program to do and what not to do (examples of correct and incorrect behavior), label them appropriately, and train a model to perform correctly on new inputs. In short, we can use machine learning to automate software development itself.</p>"},{"name":"contact","position":"4","heading":"Let us solve your problems intelligently","icon":null,"description":"Use the form below to send us a message","showAddress":false,"form":{"title":"","namePlaceholder":"Your full name*","emailPlaceholder":"Your work email*","companyPlaceholder":"Your organisation's name*","jobPlaceholder":"Your job title","messagePlaceholder":"Type your message here*","submitBtnTxt":"Submit"},"address":{"title":"","line1":"Rue Chair et Pain 3","line2":"1000 Bruselles","country":"Belgium","email":"hello@thesquaredev.com"}}]}}}
